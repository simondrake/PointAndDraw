# PointAndDraw

## Purpose

Very simple app where you select a background colour, and then select images from the bottom of the screen. When you 
press the screen it adds the image in that location, allowing the user to make a picture of sorts. 

It was primarily created as an introduction into iOS development, and to give my daughter a game to play on the iPad.
